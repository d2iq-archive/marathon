# Argument Classes

All the classes in this package provide the interface between the internal
types and the compiler. Each getter grants a direct or a computed access to
the types and other internal models.

Note that all the classes in this package implement the `BlockArguments` interface,
and can be passed as arguments to the `CompiledFragment`.
