# Marathon

Marathon is a [Mesos][Mesos] framework for long-running services.
Given that you have [Mesos][Mesos] running as the kernel for your datacenter, 
Marathon is the `init` or [upstart][upstart] daemon.
It was written by the team that also developed [Chronos][Chronos].

Marathon provides a REST API for starting, stopping, and scaling services.
There is also a Ruby [command line client](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon_client).
Marathon is written in Scala and can run in highly-available mode by running multiple Marathon instances.
The state of running tasks gets stored in the [Mesos][Mesos] state abstraction.
Features are listed below.

Marathon is a *meta framework*:
you can start other [Mesos][Mesos] frameworks such as [Chronos][Chronos] or [Storm][Storm].
It can launch anything that can be launched in a standard shell.
In fact, you can even start other Marathon instances via Marathon.

## Help

If you have questions, please post on the [Marathon Framework Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/marathon-framework) email list.
You can find [Mesos][Mesos] support in the `#mesos` channel on [freenode][freenode] (IRC).
The team at [Mesosphere](https://mesosphe.re) is also happy to answer any questions.

## Requirements

* [Mesos][Mesos] 0.14+ (see `pom.xml`)
* [Zookeeper][Zookeeper]
* JDK 1.6+
* Scala 2.10+
* Maven 3.0+

## Features

* *HA* -- run any number of Marathon schedulers, but only one gets elected as leader; if you access a non-leader, you get an HTTP redirect to the current leader
* *Basic Auth* and *SSL*
* *REST API*
* *Web UI*
* *Metrics* -- via Coda Hale's [metrics library](http://metrics.codahale.com/)
* *Service Constraints* -- e.g., only one instance of a service per rack, node, etc.
* *Service Discovery* and *Monitoring*
* *Event Subscription* -- e.g., if you need to notify an external service about task updates or state changes, you can supply an HTTP endpoint to receive notifications

## Overview

The graphic shown below depicts how Marathon runs on top of [Mesos][Mesos] together with the [Chronos][Chronos] framework.
In this case, Marathon is the first framework to be launched and it runs alongside [Mesos][Mesos].
In other words, the Marathon scheduler processes were started outside of [Mesos][Mesos] using `init`, `upstart`, or a similar tool.
Marathon launches two instances of the [Chronos][Chronos] scheduler as a Marathon task.
If either of the two [Chronos][Chronos] tasks dies -- due to underlying slave crashes, power loss in the cluster, etc. --
Marathon will re-start an [Chronos][Chronos] instance on another slave.
This approach ensures that two [Chronos][Chronos] processes are always running.

Since [Chronos][Chronos] itself is a framework and receives [Mesos][Mesos] resource offers, it can start tasks on [Mesos][Mesos].
In the use case shown below, [Chronos][Chronos] is currently running two tasks.
One dumps a production MySQL database to S3, while another sends an email newsletter to all customers via Rake.
Meanwhile, Marathon also runs the services required for the web app, in general.

The next graphic shows a more application-centric view of Marathon running three tasks: Search, Jetty, and Rails.

![Marathon1](https://raw.github.com/mesosphere/marathon/master/docs/marathon1.png "Initial Marathon")

As the website gains traction and the user base grows, we decide to scale-out the search and Rails-based services.

![Marathon2](https://raw.github.com/mesosphere/marathon/master/docs/marathon2.png "Marathon scale-out")

Imagine that one of the datacenter workers trips over a power cord and a server gets unplugged.
No problem for Marathon, it moves the affected search service and Rails instance to a node that has spare capacity.
The engineer may be temporarily embarrased, but Marathon saves him from having to explain a difficult situation!

## Setting Up And Running Marathon

First, install [Mesos][Mesos]. One easy way is via your system's package manager.

* [Ubuntu 12.04, AMD64](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/ubuntu/12.04/mesos_0.14.0_amd64.deb)
* [Ubuntu 12.10, AMD64](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/ubuntu/12.10/mesos_0.14.0_amd64.deb)
* [Debian Wheezy, AMD64](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/debian/7.0/mesos_0.14.0_amd64.deb)
* [CentOS 6.4, AMD64](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/centos/6.4/mesos_0.14.0_x86_64.rpm)
* [RedHat 6.4, AMD64](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/redhat/6.4/mesos_0.14.0_x86_64.rpm)
* [OS X, 10.7 & 10.8](https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesos-pkg/master/osx/mesos-0.14.0.pkg)

If building from source,see the [Getting Started](http://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/) page,
or the [Mesosphere tutorial](http://mesosphe.re/tutorials/building-a-distributed-fault-tolerant-framework)
for details. Using `make install` will install Mesos in `/usr/local` in the same way as these packages do.

To create a Jar for Marathon, checkout the sources and use Maven to build it:

    mvn package

### Local Mode

The following command launches Marathon on [Mesos][Mesos] in *local mode*, which is not how you would run it on your cluster.
Point your web browser to `localhost:8080` and you should see the Marathon UI.

    bin/start --master local

### Production Mode

To launch Marathon in *production mode*, you need to have both [Zookeeper][Zookeeper] and [Mesos][Mesos] running:
 
    bin/start --master zk://zk1.foo.bar,zk2.foo.bar/mesos

## Example API Usage

Using [HTTPie][HTTPie]:

    http localhost:8080/v1/apps/start id=sleep cmd='sleep 600' instances=1 mem=128 cpus=1
    http localhost:8080/v1/apps/scale id=sleep instances=2
    http localhost:8080/v1/apps/stop id=sleep

Using [Marthon Client](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon_client), the following runs [Chronos][Chronos]:

    marathon start -i chronos -u https://s3.amazonaws.com/mesosphere-binaries-public/chronos/chronos.tgz -C "./chronos/bin/demo ./chronos/config/nomail.yml ./chronos/target/chronos-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" -c 1.0 -m 1024 -H http://foo.bar:8080
