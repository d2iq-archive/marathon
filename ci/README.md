# Marathon CI pipeline

In order to be CI tool agnostic and provide the benefit of running all CI tasks
on a "local" machine, the marathon team has moved to using [Ammonite](http://www.lihaoyi.com/Ammonite/)
for CI pipelining tasks.   Ammonite is a Scala based scripting tool and is
easiest to install on a Mac with `brew install ammonite-repl`.  Other platforms
please read the Ammonite site.   The `ci` folder in the root project contains
the ammonite scripts.   The script requires the project build requirements such
as a JDK, Scala and sbt in the path.


## Using Ammonite

The ammonite script is a runnable script.  To get a list of functions to invoke execute: `./ci/pipeline`

To execute a particular function just invoke the script with function appended as in:
`./ci/pipeline compileAndTest` which will compile and test the marathon project.

## Pipeline Targets

The `ci/pipeline` script defines two primary targets

1. `jenkins`
2. `phabricator`

The `jenkins` target is excuted on every branch build by jenkins. It runs

  * `provision.killStaleTestProcesses()`
  * `provision.installMesos()`
  * `compileAndTest()`
  * `createPackages()`

The `phabricator` target runs the `jenkins` pipeline followed by Phabricator
review reporting. It is triggered with each diff update.

## Sub Targets

The `provision.*` targets prepare the Jenkins AWS nodes by killing leak
processes from older test runs and updating Mesos. You can run them locally but
be careful. The `killStaleTestProcesses` might kill process you don't want to be
gone.

The `compileAndTest` target basically runs `sbt clean test integration:test
scapegoat`. This is the main compilation step.

The `createPackages` target assembles Marathon binary packages and generates the
sha1 checksums for the zip and tarball packages. See `createPackageSha1s` in the
code base for details.

There are several targets in `githubClient`:

  * `reject`
  * `comment`
  * `collectTestResults`
  * `reportSuccess`
  * `reportFailure`

Method `reject` and `reportFailure` rejects a GitHub pull request review while `reportSuccess` approves it.
The `comment` method posts a comment to the pull request.
`collectTestResults` gathers and returns unit and integration test results. It checks `target/phabricator-test-reports/`
for JSON files and joins them.

One can comment from the CLI with
```
amm ./ci/githubClient.sc comment 777 "test from pipeline"
```
